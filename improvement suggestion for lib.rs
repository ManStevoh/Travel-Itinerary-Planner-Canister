The provided code appears to be well-structured and follows common Rust and Internet Computer (IC) canister development practices. However, I'll provide feedback based on potential improvements and technical considerations:

### 1. Use Result instead of Option for Validation

In the `add_travel_plan` and `add_accommodation` functions, you are returning `Option<T>` to handle validation failures. It might be more idiomatic to use `Result<T, E>` where `E` is an error type that provides more information about the validation failure.

### 2. Error Handling in `record_expense`

In the `record_expense` function, you're returning `Result<f64, Error>`, but the error type is `Error::DecodeError`. It might be more appropriate to have a different error variant for expense-related errors, such as `Error::InvalidExpense`.

### 3. Clarify Use of `thread_local!`

The extensive use of `thread_local!` might be worth explaining or documenting in comments, especially for developers who may not be familiar with its use.

### 4. Consider Refactoring `do_insert_travel_plan` and Similar Functions

The `do_insert_travel_plan`, `do_insert_accommodation`, and similar functions could potentially be refactored into a more generic function that accepts the storage map, key, and value, reducing code duplication.

### 5. Use `match` for Multiple Pattern Matching

In several places, you use `if` statements for multiple pattern matching. Consider using `match` for a more concise and idiomatic Rust style.

### 6. Clarify Comment in `set_budget`

The comment in the `set_budget` function mentions "Set an initial value," but the initial value is set to zero. Consider updating the comment for clarity.

### 7. Documentation

Consider adding comments or documentation to explain the purpose of each function, especially for public interfaces.

### 8. Unit Testing

Adding unit tests for critical functionality would enhance the reliability of the canister. Ensure that common use cases, edge cases, and error scenarios are covered in the tests.

### 9. Use `expect` with Descriptive Error Messages

In functions like `do_insert_travel_plan`, where `unwrap` is used, consider using `expect` with descriptive error messages to provide more context in case of a panic.

### 10. Cargo Clippy and Formatting

Consider running `cargo clippy` to catch potential issues and applying `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting.

### Summary

The code is generally well-written, but these suggestions aim to enhance readability, maintainability, and adherence to Rust conventions. Incorporating these suggestions may lead to a more robust and understandable codebase.
